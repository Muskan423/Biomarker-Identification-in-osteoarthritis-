 A bioinformatics-driven project to identify potential biomarkers involved in osteoarthritis using transcriptomic data analysis, statistical methods, and machine learning.
 Project Overview
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease with significant global impact. Identifying reliable biomarkers can aid early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic strategies.
This project involves:
Data acquisition from public repositories (e.g., GEO)
Differential gene expression analysis (DGE)
Biomarker filtering using machine learning (optional)
Visualization and interpretation of results
 Methods Used
Data Source: GEO Database
Steps:
Preprocessing & normalization
Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
Volcano plot & heatmap generation
Gene Ontology (GO) & pathway enrichment
 SVM for biomarker prioritization
HIGHLIGHTS :
 Used curated transcriptomic datasets (OA vs Normal)
 Applied robust statistical thresholding (adj.p < 0.05, |log2FC| > 1)
Integration of biological knowledge for prioritization
